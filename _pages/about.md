Hi all, I'm currently an R&D Computer Engineer at NAVAIR Lakehurst where I work in the Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) lab. I've been working as a researcher here since July of 2020 and in that time I've worked on a wide range of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics projects. In late 2021 I secured funding to act as the principal investigator on a research effort exploring the feasability of an autonomous robotic firefighting system for the U.S Navy and have been leading a team of other research engineers since then. At the moment, I am also currently working on research efforts for object detection and tracking using various sensor modalities, verification and validation of machine learning systems, and exploring generative models for improving the effectiveness of synthetic data in computer vision applications.

In late 2022 I took advantage of NAVAIR's rotation program and worked at the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence (NCARAI) for several months alongside [Dr. Leslie Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pwh7Pw4AAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to joining NAVAIR I received my Bachelor's degree from Stevens Institute of Technology in 2020. During my time there I was a research assistant in the Quantum Enhanced Systems and Technology ([QuEST](http://www.questlab.us/)) and Robust Field Autonomy ([RFAL](https://robustfieldautonomylab.github.io/index.html)) Labs. I also interned with NAVAIR several times and worked in 4 of their labs across my internships.
